Welcome to wxPython's Project Phoenix! Phoenix is the improved next-generation
wxPython, "better, stronger, faster than he was before." This new
implementation is focused on improving speed, maintainability and
extensibility. Just like "Classic" wxPython, Phoenix wraps the wxWidgets C++
toolkit and provides access to the user interface portions of the wxWidgets
API, enabling Python applications to have a native GUI on Windows, Macs or
Unix systems, with a native look and feel and requiring very little (if any)
platform specific code.

For more information please refer to the
`README file <https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/blob/wxPython-4.0.1/README.rst>`_,
the `Migration Guide <http://docs.wxPython.org/MigrationGuide.html>`_,
or the `wxPython API documentation <http://docs.wxPython.org/index.html>`_.

Archive files containing a copy of the wxPython documentation, the demo and
samples, and also a set of MSVC .pdb files for Windows are available
`here <https://extras.wxPython.org/wxPython4/extras/>`_.

The utility tools wxdocs and wxdemo will download the appropriate files with wxget,
(if necessary), unpack them, (if necessary) and launch the appropriate version of
the respective items. (Documents are launched in the default browser and demo is started
with python).
